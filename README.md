# SENSE-spaces-webapp-csit321
This project aims to provide a web accessible application that will allow users to plan and visualise a multi-sensory environment within a user-defined space. The app will have a baseline set of equipment that is available by default, and also have the capability to import specific equipment if a user has something more suited to their needs.
